# Boids Simulation

This is an implementation of a boids simulation in C++ using the SFML library.



## Try it yourself!

```
git clone https://github.com/kristiansordal/Boids
cd Boids
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
build/boids
```

## TODO
- ✅ Implement proper movement of multiple boids without rules
- ✅ Implement cohesion, alignment and separation
- ❌ Implement predators
