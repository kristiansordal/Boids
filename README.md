# Boids Simulation

This repository will attempt to create a simulation of Boids using the SFML library for C++.

## Try it yourself!

```
git clone https://github.com/kristiansordal/Boids
cd Boids
cmake -B build/debug
cmake --build build/debug
build/debug/boids
```

## TODO
- ✅ Implement proper movement of multiple boids without rules
- ❌ Implement cohesion, alignment and separation
- ❌ Implement predators
